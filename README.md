# BKMM_EOS_prediction
Two scripts to utilize the EOS package to estimate the central values and corresponding uncertainties:
The script "estimate_BKMM_obs.py" uses form factors and likelihood constraint of "@BFW2010", while the script "estimate_BKMM_obs_2.py" uses form factors likelihood constraint of "@BSZ2015".
The other setups of the two scripts are the almost the same.
The observables to be estimated are angular observables "B->Kll::A_FB" and "B->Kll::F_H", branching fraction "B->Kll::BR", CP asymmetry "B->Kll::A_CP"
